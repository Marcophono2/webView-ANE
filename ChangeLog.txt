Rich WebView Adobe Air Native Extension

*Feb 21, 2016 - V6.1.0*
* New property added to move the Android Task to background ```moveAndroidTaskToBack()```
* New listener to know when RichWebView is touched ```RichWebViewEvent.TOUCH```
* Fixed the setViewPort bug in iOS which used to scroll the content to the top of the page. that won't happen anymore just like the Android side
* Fixed other minor bugs

*Feb 13, 2016 - V6.0.0*
* Supporting iFrame embeded videos
* Removed AirBridge.js altogether! you won't see it anymore but it's there and will be injected into any html page that will be loaded. This will be a huge help to you to keep things as clean as possible.
* Corrected misspelling of the ```RECEIVED_MESSAGE_FROM_JS``` listener
* Introduced ```RichWebViewSettings``` class where you can set different options for your WebView on how it performs. As a result, you don't have to set the settings when initializing the extension in the constructor. instead you can set settings from the RichWebViewSettings class. old settings like gps and screenshots are there plus some new settings.
* Added a cool feature to RichWebViewSettings is ```BG_COLOR_HEX``` which supports alpha channel too. for example this means a complete white bg ```RichWebViewSettings.BG_COLOR_HEX = "#FFFFFFFF";``` while the following means a transparent bg ```RichWebViewSettings.BG_COLOR_HEX = "#00FFFFFF";```
* Set keyboardDisplayRequiresUserAction on iOS to NO by default.
* Added ```hide()``` method and ```visible``` property to make the webview in/visible easily and fast


*Jan 20, 2016 - V5.1*
* Bypassing xCode 7.2 bug causing iOS conflict when compiling with AirSDK 20 without waiting on Adobe or Apple to fix the problem. This is a must have upgrade for your app to make sure you can compile multiple ANEs in your project with AirSDK 20 or greater. https://forums.adobe.com/thread/2055508 https://forums.adobe.com/message/8294948


*Jan 03, 2015 - V5.0*
* Added support for loading local html files from File.applicationStorageDirectory too
* The bridge javascript code will now be injected into html pages automatically from the extension so you don't have to add the js file to your html content anymore
* When using RichWebview ANE, there is a "AirBridge.js" file on the root next to the main Air .swf file and you should NOT move or rename this file because native side is using this file to inject js functions into loaded html pages
* You may use this js file to add your own js functions to inject along with our current code which is necesary for the ANE to function correctly
* From this version, you must call AirBridge.evoke() method to call functions on the Air side. so make sure you have studied and tested the extension fully before adding it into your projects which is using older versions of this extension
